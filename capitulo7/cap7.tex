In this work, we presented a modified version of Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol to work without MAC layer timestamping. To keep accuracy as high as possible, we use radio interrupts to measure the instant nodes get medium access. Senders use correction messages in addition to synchronization messages in order to compensate their synchronization timestamps with medium access delay.

In our experiments, we ran tests on Micaz motes running TinyOS 2.1.2 to measure correction times, processing times and medium access time. We showed that medium access time is the main source of synchronization error and quantified it in a real testbed. We also showed that processing times are very small, on average $0.87$ jiffys. 

In future work, we want to precisely measure the synchronization error using a high accuracy external clock to measure timing error between synchronization events among the network motes.
